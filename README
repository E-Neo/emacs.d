My Emacs config
===============

Features
--------
1. IDE for:
  - C/C++
  - OCaml
  - Python
  - Haskell
2. Org-mode exports to LaTeX with Chinese supported and syntax highlighting.
3. Audio/Video player.

Installation
------------
Just
  git clone git@github.com:E-Neo/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
Please note that if you write OCaml make sure you have opam, merlin and utop
installed, or you can just comment out (require 'init-ocaml) in init.el.
Have fun!
